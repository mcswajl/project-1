AS a researcher looking for some information about random cats or dogs
I WANT to be able to take that information as i please
SO THAT I can work on the project at hand



GIVEN I need a website that gives some facts about cats and dogs
WHEN I arrive to said website its clear what its about
THEN I am presented with options as to which animal I want facts about
WHEN I find that section i am given the the option to display some facts
THEN I can either use those facts or proceed to diplay another group of facts
WHEN I am finished gathering the information i need
THEN I am given the option to give feedback





We wanted to create a website that just gives the user some small information about some cats and dogs. We created a nav bar that allows the user to jump from section to section at will.

We then created a display facts section that shoots out random facts about either cats or dogs at will. Everytime you click this button it will give you another random fact.

We also included a side bar that gives the most popular breeds of both cats and dogs just as an extra fact

We wanted the user to have some form of interaction with our website so we created a section that allows the user to also include their own facts of either cats or dogs.

The information they provide is then stored in local storage
